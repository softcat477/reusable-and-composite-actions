      - main
  workflow_dispatch:
  
env:
  env1: "An environment variable in caller workflow in ${{github.event.repository.name}}"

      input1: "This-is-input-1-from-caller-workflow-in-${{github.event.repository.name}}"
    secrets:
      secret1: ${{ secrets.secret0 }}

  show-output-from-reuse-workflow:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    needs: run-reuse-workflow
    steps:
      - name: Print single-line output
        run: echo '${{needs.run-reuse-workflow.outputs.reuse-workflow-out1}}'
      - name: Print multi-line output
        run: echo '${{needs.run-reuse-workflow.outputs.reuse-workflow-out2}}'
```

## Composite Action
üêü More details: [Composite Action](composite-action.md)
```yaml=

        with:
          input1: "An input assigned to composite actions"

      - name: Print the single-line from the composite action
        run: echo "The single-line output is:${{steps.composite-action.outputs.composite-action-out1}}"

      - name: Print the multi-line from the composite action
        run: echo 'The multi-line output is:${{steps.composite-action.outputs.composite-action-out2}}'
